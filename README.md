# (More than just) dotfiles

Ok, so dotfiles are back on the menu.

### OS-specific configs

Configuration for each OS is within the appropriately named directory (e.g. `macos/` for macOS)

- `dotfiles/`: Conventional dotfiles
- `pkgs/`: Globally installed software packages for reference and backup

### Misc

- `links/`: Content that should be publicly accessible (RSS, webpages)
- `templates/`: Reasonable defaults for bootstrapping projects
