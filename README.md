# (More than just) dotfiles

Ok, so dotfiles are back on the menu.

### OS-specific config

I daily drive macOS at the moment, so everything of note currently resides in `macos/`

- `dotfiles/`: Dotfiles for software config, with a symlink script provided
- `pkgs/`: Globally installed software packages and libraries, mainly for reference

### Misc

- `starters/`: Reasonable defaults for bootstrapping projects
