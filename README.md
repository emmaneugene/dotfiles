# Dotfiles

### OS-specific configs

Core dotfiles for each major OS are within the appropriately named directory.

There is a handy script to symlink them directly to your home directory

```bash
# If you want the macos stuff
./symlink.sh macos
```

### Misc

- `templates/`: I like to keep track of defaults for bootstrapping projects because idk, I'm old-fashioned.
